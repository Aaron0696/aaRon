# aaRon

`aaRon` is a package created to consolidate self-defined functions that I use in my daily work. The functions in this package are nothing ground-breaking, but they do make daily life a little easier. 

As I am psychology-trained, most of these functions are related to common analysis/manipulation in psychology. E.g, `code.reverse()` made reverse-coding items easier, `aggregateScale()` is a single function that allowed us to calculate the sum/mean while ensuring that respondents with a certain percentage of missing items are coded as *NA*.

Some of these functions are built on existing functions from other packages such as:

* `lavaan`
* `knitr`
* `htmltools`
* `tidyr`
* `psych`

This document is meant to be a showcase of these functions, coupled with short explanations on their usage. This will be updated when more functions are added.    

# use.style()

In .Rmd files, this function calls CSS from `aaRon` which styles the knitted html document. This document itself is styled this way.

There are two options to choose from, **work** and **casual**. Main difference between the two are the colors, casual uses more flashy blue/green compared to work.

```{r}
aaRon::use.style(mode = "casual")
# aaRon::use.style(mode = "work")
```

# fct2num()

```{r}
a <- factor(c("Agree","Disagree","Agree","Agree","Disagree"))
fct2num(a)
fct2num(a, start = 0) # if likert scales begin at 0
```

# efa.diag()

```{r}
efa.diag(HolzingerSwineford1939[,7:15])
```

# tall.loadings()

```{r}
myefa <- fa(Harman74.cor$cov, 4, fm = "wls")
tall.loadings(myefa$Structure)
tall.loadings(myefa$loadings)
```

# aggregateScale()

```{r}
mydata <- data.frame(a = c(1:8,NA,NA), b = 1:10, c = rep(NA,10))
mydata
aggregateScale(mydata)
aggregateScale(mydata, NA.threshold = 0.2) # less than 0.2 missingness
```

# vlookup()

```{r}
mydata <- data.frame(Type = rep(1:3,5), Rand = 4:6)
mytable <- data.frame(Type = 1:3, Magnitude = c("Low","Medium","High"))
vlookup(data = mydata,
        lookup_table = mytable,
        data_col = "Type",
        lookup_col = "Type",
        lookup_value = "Magnitude")
```

# auto.class()

```{r}
# return numeric
auto.class(1:100)

# return factor
auto.class(rep(1:7,10))

# return character
auto.class(c(1:100,"hello"))

# return factor
auto.class(c("Strongly Agree","Agree","Disagree","Strongly Disagree"))

# use with lapply to apply across entire dataframe
mydata <- data.frame(A = 1:100, B = c(1:99,"hello"))
mydata <- data.frame(lapply(mydata, FUN = auto.class))
str(mydata)
```

# code.reverse()

```{r}
mydata <- data.frame(myscale = c("Disagree", "Neutral", "Agree", "Neutral","Agree"))
code.reverse(vector = mydata$myscale, original_levels = c("Disagree","Neutral","Agree"))
```

# prettyalpha()

```{r, results = "asis"}
myalpha <- alpha(HolzingerSwineford1939[,7:15])
prettyalpha(myalpha)
```

# prettylavaan()

```{r}
# the famous Holzinger and Swineford (1939) example
HS.model <-  "visual  =~ x1 + x2 + x3
              textual =~ x4 + x5 + x6
              speed   =~ x7 + x8 + x9"
fit <- cfa(HS.model, data = HolzingerSwineford1939)
prettylavaan(fit, output_format = "datatable")
```

```{r}
# using robust estimators
robustfit <- cfa(HS.model, data = HolzingerSwineford1939, estimator = "MLM")
# request for robust fit indices
prettylavaan(robustfit, output_format = "datatable", robust = TRUE)
```

```{r}
# for piping to kableExtra for further editing
# note: library(kableExtra) may mess up formatting of normal kable tables in the same Rmd document
# refer to https://github.com/haozhu233/kableExtra/issues/265
# format = "html" is required to work with kableExtra
library(kableExtra)
mylist <- prettylavaan(robustfit, output_format = "kableExtra", format = "html", robust = TRUE)
mylist$Param %>% kable_styling(font_size = 9)
```
