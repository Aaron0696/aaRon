# Setup

Load data and packages.

```{r, warning = FALSE, message = FALSE, include = TRUE}

```

# Scale Descriptions

A table that displays the **variable names** and their **description/content** side-by-side. Helps readers to understand the content of the scale and sub-scales.

```{r}
# datatable()
```

# Univariate Statistics {.tabset}

Item-level information to help identify problematic items.

## Distribution

Item-level response distribution, take note of skewed distributions.

```{r}

```

## Summary Statistics

Item-level descriptive statistics.

```{r}
# psych::describe()
```

# Correlation Matrix

A good scale should show "triangular"/"square" hotspots of positive correlations.

```{r}
# corrplot::corrplot()
```

# Cronbach Alphas

Calculate Cronbach Alpha using `alpha()` from the `psych` package.

```{r}
# psych::alpha() %>% aaRon::prettyalpha()
```

# Confirmatory Factor Analysis

Conduct a CFA to assess the factor structure and *Unidimensionality* using `cfa()` from the `lavaan` package. Consider doing one CFA for each subscale and one for the full scale.

```{r}
# lavaan::cfa() %>% aaRon::prettylavaan()
```

# Correlations With Other Scales

A preliminary look at the validity of the scale. Does it correlate with things that are theoretically related and not correlate with things that are theoretically distant?

```{r}

```
